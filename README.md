## Classification of Stars, Galaxies and Quasars based on spectral characterisitcs. 

### Abstract:

Apply various machine learning models to classify Stars, Galaxies, and Quasars based on spectral characteristics using 100k labeled sources from **The Sloan Digital Sky Survey** (SDSS) data release 17. 


### Purpose:

The early classification, distribution and cataloging of stars has helped us understand that they make up our galaxy, more powerful telescopes have since been created and thousands of galaxies began to be investigated. To accelerate discoveries in astronomy and astrophysics through the support of an all-sky spectroscopic observation program that uses telescopes in both hemispheres to comprehensively map the night sky, examine the history and structure of the universe, and probe the physics of black holes. These next generation telescopes are predicted to significantly increase the size of source catalogues and it is becoming unfeasible for astronomers to manually verify and label indivual sources.

While efforts such as Galaxy Zoo (Lintott et al. 2008, 2011) bring in many more people to help sift through data, this effort alone is not expected to be able to keep up with the source counts anticipated for the next generation of telescopes. For such large datasets, machine learning algorithms are becoming an increasingly valuable tool for analysis and data exploration. The development of such algorithms in computer science fields has accelerated rapidly in the last decade, focusing on processing large datasets in high performance computing workflows and cloud computing systems (Jones 2014; Wu et al. 2016).

We would like to use these machine learning algorithms to accelerate discoveries in astronomy and astrophysics through the support of an all-sky spectroscopic observation program that uses telescopes in both hemispheres to comprehensively map the night sky, examine the history and structure of the universe, and probe the physics of black holes.
