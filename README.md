### Selected topic:

**The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)** is one of the largest, most detailed, and most often cited astronomical surveys that has ever existed, with the goal of expanding our understanding of the large-scale evolution and structure of the universe, the formation of stars and galaxies, the history of the Milky Way, the nature of supermassive black holes, and the science behind dark energy. By comprehensively mapping and across over a third of the night sky, SDSS represents one of the major quests of contemporary physics and has spurred advancement on answering a range of fundamental questions about the origins of the universe.

To accelerate discoveries in astronomy and astrophysics through the support of an all-sky spectroscopic observation program that uses telescopes in both hemispheres to comprehensively map the night sky, examine the history and structure of the universe, and probe the physics of black holes.

In astronomy, stellar classification is the classification of stars based on their spectral characteristics. The classification scheme of galaxies, quasars, and stars is one of the most fundamental in astronomy. The early cataloguing of stars and their distribution in the sky has led to the understanding that they make up our own galaxy and, following the distinction that Andromeda was a separate galaxy to our own, numerous galaxies began to be surveyed as more powerful telescopes were built. This datasat aims to classificate stars, galaxies, and quasars based on their spectral characteristics.

### Reason for selecting topic:

The early classification and distribution of stars helped us understand that they made up our galaxy. As we realized Andromeda was a separate galaxy from our own, more powerful telescopes were created and thousands of galaxies began to be investigated. With this dataset, we aim to help classify stars, galaxies, and quasars according to their spectral properties.
