## A Quick Guide to Get Started

1. On this page for this repository, click on the button `Fork` at the top right-hand corner.

2. Clone your **forked repository** to your computer (make sure to replace `your-github-username`):
  > git clone https://github.com/java2509/Da_Vinci_Code.git

3. In your terminal/command prompt, shift to project directory:
  > cd Da_Vinci_Code

4. Before you make any changes, make sure to keep your fork in sync to avoid merge conflicts:
  > git remote add upstream https://github.com/wonhee3472/Da_Vinci_Code.git
  
  > git pull upstream master

* If you run into a **merge conflict**, you have to resolve the conflict. It's always best to avoid the conflict and there are a lot of guides online so you can refer to them once you encounter one.

5. After adding the upstream and checking that all filees are up to date, we now will create a new branch before editing any files:
  > git checkout -b branch-name

6. On your computer, open your VS Code, and add your name to the `Contributors` section above.

7. Add the changes with `git add`, `git commit` (write a good commit message; detailed messages are always good!):
  > git add README.md
  
  > git commit -m "Adding my name to README.md"

8. Push your changes to your repository:
  > git push origin branch-name

9. Go to the GitHub page of *your fork*, and make a pull request.

10. Wait for group mates' approvals on your pull request. If there are any conflicts, you will get a notification.
